# PhotoPaster

PhotoPaster is a simple Python script for pasting or processing photos. 

## Disclaimer: Windows Only
PhotoPaster only works on Windows because it copies image files as files to the clipboard, allowing you to paste or upload multiple images at once (e.g., in WhatsApp Web). Linux and macOS do not natively support copying files to the clipboard for batch uploadsâ€”only text and raw image data are reliably supported, not file references. For this reason, the script is not cross-platform.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python photo_paster.py
   ```
3. Follow any prompts or instructions in the terminal.
